## A Novel Divide and Combine based Approach to Estimating Mixture Markov Model for Analyzing Large Categorical Time Series Data
Please see the abstract and dissertation proposal of this study for details
### Data
* Data used for case study are obtained by combining five waves of National Household Travel Survey (1990, 1995, 2001, 2009, 2017)
* Script for data preparation can be found under Data Preparation folder

### Scripts
* divide data.R: R script for randomly split a large dataset to multiple subsamples
* MMM_estimation.R: R script for estimating Mixture Markov models for each subsample
* combine_result.R: R script for combining model estimation results from all subsamples and then apply hierarchical clustering method for obtaining final clustering solution
* Plot.R: R script for plotting daily activity-travel patterns
* post_analysis: R script for exploring influence factors of activity-travel behavior
